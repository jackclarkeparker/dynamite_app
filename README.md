# Lesson Manager
Lesson Manager is an ongoing project aimed at automating admin tasks and delivering improved customer experiences in interactions with a music teaching business. It currently focuses on core functionalities for storing validated business entity data in a Postgres database through a user-friendly interface.

## Future Enhancements
The current version focuses on core CRUD functionalities, but the project has plenty of exciting future development paths:

#### Front-end for Customers:
Implement a customer-facing front-end for booking lessons, viewing practice updates and other notices, and viewing current and past invoices.

#### Back-end for Tutors:
Develop a dedicated back-end for tutors, enabling lesson scheduling updates, client-record management, roll generation, attendance tracking, and practice update delivery.

#### Invoicing and Payments:
Integrate a robust invoicing system with the above to aid in sending and tracking invoices.

#### Student "Practice Diary":
A portal for tracking practice reps through the week, a metronome to practice alongside, and the opportunity to record performances to share with friends.
